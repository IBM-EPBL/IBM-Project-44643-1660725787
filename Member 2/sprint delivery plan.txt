Digitisation of Railways Includes:

.) B-scan ultrasonic rail flaw detection (both non-stop and stop-and-verify systems) and track inspection with automated high-speed test trains.

.) Train control system levels 2 and 3 for high-density routes to increase network capacity and maintain the required safety standards.

.) Increased surveillance of personnel with both interior and exterior locomotive-mounted video surveillance to improve monitoring.

.) Track-laying machines for mechanisation of construction.

.) Electrification through machines such as self-propelled overhead electrification laying trains.

.) Complete train scanners for improved diagnostics and maintenance.

.) Use of distributed power to improve the efficiency of train operations with coordinated acceleration and deceleration.

.) Establishment of smart railway stations by implementing access control at entry points.

.) e-ticketing with services such as infotainment and app-based systems.

.) Use of training simulators and virtual reality (VR) training systems to improve personnel capabilities.
